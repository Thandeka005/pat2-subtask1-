Overview of Morse Code:
Morse code is a method of encoding textual information through a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). It was designed to transmit messages using simple signals like sound, light, or visual signals, making it versatile for various communication methods.

Historical Context:
Developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, Morse code was created to facilitate long-distance telegraph communication. During the 19th century, the telegraph revolutionized how information was transmitted across continents and oceans, enabling near-instantaneous communication. Morse code became the standard language for telegraphy because it could be efficiently sent over electrical wires and later adapted for radio communication. Its simplicity and efficiency made it invaluable for maritime, military, and emergency communication, especially before the advent of digital communication technologies.

How Morse Code Works:
Morse code translates each letter, numeral, or punctuation into a unique sequence of dots and dashes:

- Dot (·):** A short signal.
- Dash (–):** A longer signal.

For example:
- Letter "A" is represented as ·–
- Letter "B" as –···
- Number "1" as ·––––

Messages are transmitted by turning a transmitter on and off or by flashing lights, with timing conventions to distinguish dots from dashes and spaces between letters and words:

- A dot is one time unit.
- A dash is three time units.
- The space between parts of the same letter is one time unit.
- The space between letters is three time units.
- The space between words is seven time units.
